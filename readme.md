## Introduction

Stationeers Dedicated Server Control is a user-friendly, web-based tool for managing a Stationeers dedicated server. It features an intuitive retro computer-themed interface, allowing you to easily start and stop the server, view real-time server output, manage configurations, and handle backups‚Äîall from your web browser.

Additionally, it offers full Discord integration, enabling you and your community to monitor and manage the server directly from a Discord server. Features include real-time server status updates, console output, and the ability to start, stop, and restore backups via Discord commands.

**Important:** For security reasons, do not expose this UI directly to the internet without a secure authentication mechanism. Do not port forward the UI directly.

     - Click on **Advanced settings**.
     - Select **Inbound Rules** and click on **New Rule...**.
     - Choose **Port** and click **Next**.
     - for the gameserver, select **TCP** and enter `27015, 27016` in the **Specific local ports** field.
     - for the WebUI(This Software), select **TCP** and enter `8080` in the **Specific local ports** field.
     - Click **Next**.
     - Choose **Allow the connection** and click **Next**.
     - Select the network profiles of your choise (Domain, Private, Public) and click **Next**.
     - Name the rule (e.g., "Stationeers Server Ports") and click **Finish**.
